# Array Manipulation Tasks

This project showcases a variety of array manipulation tasks implemented in JavaScript. The code includes functions to print developers, add data, remove admins, concatenate arrays, calculate average age, check age above 25, find unique professions, sort by age, update John's profession, and get the count of professions. Below are explanations for each function:

## Code Explanations

### 1. Print Developers
- **Approach 1**: Using a `for of` loop to iterate through the `data` array and print developers.
- **Approach 2**: Utilizing a simple `for` loop to achieve the same result.

### 2. Add Data
- Prompting the user for input to create a new data object with name, age, and profession.
- Adding the new object to the `data` array and logging the updated array.

### 3. Remove Admins
- Filtering the `data` array to create a new array excluding objects with the 'admin' profession.
- Logging the filtered array.

### 4. Concatenate Array
- Creating a new object and concatenating it to the `data` array.
- Logging the concatenated array.

### 5. Average Age
- Calculating and logging the average age of objects in the `data` array.

### 6. Age Check Above 25
- Checking and logging objects with age above 25 from the `data` array.

### 7. Unique Professions
- Using a `Set` to get unique professions and logging them as an array.

### 8. Sort by Age
- Sorting the `data` array based on age in ascending order.

### 9. Update John's Profession
- Finding John's entry in the `data` array and updating his profession to "manager".
- Logging the updated array.

### 10. Profession Count
- Counting and logging the total number of objects in the `data` array.

## Running the Project

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. Click on the buttons to trigger various array manipulation tasks.
3. Observe the results in the console.

Feel free to explore and modify the JavaScript functions in the script file (`script.js`) for further customization of the array manipulation tasks.
